While there might not be a specific model trained to classify fossil images we can still make use of a model trained on other types of images. We are going to use the **ResNet50** model, a CNN 50-layers deep trained on more than a million labelled images such as ballons or strawberries from https://www.image-net.org/. To be able to use it for classifying fossils, we are going to use a principle called *Transfer Learning*: we will use a model trained on some data and apply it on some other data. \n",
